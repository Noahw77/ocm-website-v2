    <h1>Approach</h1>
    <h2>How we invest</h2>
    <p>We focus primarily on U.S.-listed technology, media, and telecom companies. By exploiting temporary market dislocations and sentiment-driven pressures, we acquire exceptional businesses at attractive valuations. Through a concentrated portfolio of our highest-conviction holdings, we compound capital tax-efficiently over long horizons to deliver superior returns.

Our framework could be applied broadly, but we believe our greatest edge lies in technology—where deep expertise and long experience give us a decisive advantage.</p>
    <h2>Why we focus on Technology</h2>
    <p>With over 25 years of expertise analyzing and investing in technology, we bring insight to a sector that consistently drives innovation and market leadership. Our philosophy is straightforward: invest in what we know best. Technology is the engine of growth, disruption, and long-term value creation, making it our core focus.

For decades, technology has led the market, producing global leaders, delivering strong returns, and outpacing other industries. Powered by transformative trends like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, semiconductors, and digital transformation, technology’s influence and potential continue to grow. We believe its blend of innovation, resilience, and growth makes it a compelling opportunity for long-term investment success.</p>
